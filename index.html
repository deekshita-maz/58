    <p> In the begining of 2020 cam the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone was not allowed to go out of their house cause of how fast the disease was spreading. So I decided to spend my time learning a new hobby, coding! I decided to join WhiteHatJr and started learning coding. At first I found it but now I've mastered it and I love it! I hope to become a great coder one day!</p>
